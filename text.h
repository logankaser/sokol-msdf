    Overview:

        Shader program 'text':
            Get shader desc: text_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_Position = 0
                    ATTR_vs_RawUV = 1
            Fragment shader: fs
                Uniform block 'PassFragment':
                    C struct: PassFragment_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_PassFragment = 0
                Image 'msdf':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_msdf = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader text = sg_make_shader(text_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_Position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_RawUV] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_msdf = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'PassFragment':

        PassFragment_t PassFragment = {
            .bgColor = ...;
            .fgColor = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_PassFragment, &SG_RANGE(PassFragment));
